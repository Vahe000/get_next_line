Get Next Line Project

The get_next_line project is a function that reads a file descriptor line by line, without losing the reading thread. This project is part of the 42 School curriculum.

Description

The get_next_line function reads a file descriptor (FD) and returns a string containing the next line from the FD. This function is useful for reading from a file or standard input one line at a time, without losing the reading thread.

The function should be able to handle multiple file descriptors, and should return the correct line for each file descriptor when called consecutively.

Installation

To use the get_next_line function, simply add the get_next_line.c and get_next_line.h files to your project. The function requires the libft library, which is also part of the 42 School curriculum.
